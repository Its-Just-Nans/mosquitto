			SHA1 of the private key password when using an TLS engine. Some TLS
			engines such as the TPM engine may require the use of a password in
			order to be accessed. This option allows a hex encoded SHA1 hash of
			the password to the engine directly, instead of the user being
			prompted for the password.
