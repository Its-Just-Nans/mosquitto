            When using certificate based encryption, this option disables
            verification of the server hostname in the server certificate. This
            can be useful when testing initial server configurations but makes
            it possible for a malicious third party to impersonate your server
            through DNS spoofing, for example. Use this option in testing
            only. If you need to resort to using this option in a production
            environment, your setup is at fault and there is no point using
            encryption.
