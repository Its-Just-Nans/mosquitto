			Disable 'clean session' / enable persistent client mode. When this
			argument is used, the broker will be instructed not to clean
			existing sessions for the same client id when the client connects,
			and sessions will never expire when the client disconnects. MQTT v5
			clients can change their session expiry interval with the
			<option>-x</option> argument.
		</para>
		<para>
			When a session is persisted on the broker, the subscriptions for the
			client will be maintained after it disconnects, along with
			subsequent QoS 1 and QoS 2 messages that arrive. When the client
			reconnects and does not clean the session, it will receive all of
			the queued messages.
		</para>
		<para>
			If using this option, the client id must be set manually with
			<option>--id</option>.
